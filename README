This repository contains the boost library with bazel build rules.

We recommend putting this repository in //third_party/boost, and then you can
reference to individual boost libraries like:

cc_binary(
    # ...
    deps = [
        # ...
        "//third_party/boost:asio",
    ],
)

Pull requests to add more boost libraries or adding other ways of using these
libraries are welcome.

Currently pinned to boost-1.68.0. Tested under linux and Windows.
